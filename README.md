# node-ts-docker-sandbox


Time to modernize! Simple sandbox stage for creating a webserver with Node.js, TypeScript, and Docker. Clone and use however you want. Just don't commit to master. Or do. I don't care.

Use branches and leave them open when demoing a new concept


# Use:

#### Docker-Compose:

Start it up:
```
$ > docker compose up --build
```

Tear it down:
```
$ > docker compose stop 
```
